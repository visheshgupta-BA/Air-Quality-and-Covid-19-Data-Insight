# COVID-19 and Air Quality in the United States

<p>This project aims to investigate the relationship between long-term average exposure to low air quality and the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in the United States. The project uses two data sources: (1) Air Quality Index (AQI) data from 1980 to 2021 and (2) COVID-19 case surveillance data from 2020 to 2021.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data with Geography</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Time frame: 2020-01-01 to 2021-11-09</li>
  <li>Records: 37,532,072</li>
  <li>File size: 109,903,673 bytes (5,304,693,020 bytes uncompressed)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>The project will answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did the lockdown result in a noticeable improvement in air quality? Most notably in what regions?</li>
  <li>Is there a correlation between Air Quality Index (AQI) and COVID-19 hospitalization rate?</li>
  <li>Are there any confounding factors you should control for?</li>
  <li>How would you present the results visually? How do you label your axes?</li>
  <li>How did you treat missing data?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The analysis will be conducted using statistical methods and data visualization techniques
